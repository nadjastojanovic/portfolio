                    <p>Located in the heart of Dakar, Asma Audit & Conseil is a multidisciplinary accounting firm, working with a large number of companies in the areas of accounting, advisory, and auditing.</p>
                        
                    <p>This is my most recent project and I have chosen to highlight it because it involved starting from scratch to achieve the company's goals through rebranding and a website redesign. My role consisted of recognizing problems with the existing website and creating a new, better online presence for Asma Audit & Conseil.</p>

                    <p class="details">Working on a redesign, it is important to analyze the current website 
                        and focus on areas which require improvement. In this particular case, 
                        some of the things I noted were too much text, lack of dynamic content, 
                        difficulties while navigating the website and poor visual elements.

                        to a successful rebranding. Communication was key in determining 
                        which creative direction I should take as I worked on the color 
                        palette, logo design and the overall feel of the website.

The goal was to make the new UVCT website more modern and minimalistic while maintaining a blue and grey colour scheme. The current website had plenty of information for visitors, but it was crowded and very hard to find specifically what you're looking. I got to work and here is the look I came up with using Figma.</p>

                    <p>Urivi Vikram Charitable Trust is an Indian non-governmental organization promoting education among the impoverished youth. My first encounter with UVCT happened through an acquaintance. After I familiarised myself with their vision, I knew I wanted to intern there. I became a graphic designer intern.<p>
                    <p>As part of this role, I designed banners and posters for some of their workshops and events, as well as the annual report. I was also in charge of maintaining the website and uploading the content I had created. I worked directly with the Organisational Development director.</p>
                    <p>This internship is one of the first instances of me dabbling in professional design and development. As a result, it was eye-opening in terms of team work, communication and collaboration skills, as well as web development and design etiquette.</p>

                    <p>After some time, we reconnected and settled on a plan to redesign their website and create something even better, more dynamic and with added functionalities. The current Wild Blue Catering website has everything a business like theirs may need. This includes integration with the Clover POS, online ordering and menus, as well as plenty of information on the background of WBC, their location and contact and a lot more.

                    <p>Perspektiva is a project I worked on through a Web Development 
                        course in my school. The goal was to create a simplistic, 
                        but still informative, one page website. The focus lies 
                        in promoting the school magazine among students and offering 
                        an insight into the team behind it.

                        while completing the Odin Project's curriculum.
                        Through these exercises I have learned a lot about
                        JavaScript and its implementation in the front end world.

                    <p>
                        More specifically, I used DOM, event listeners, data attributes,
                        switch statements, functions and loops.
